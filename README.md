As a Self-Taught, I know is hard to prove to someone our own capabilities to do something. So we tend to look to the curriculum of that person, the college he or she did, the boot camps, certifies, etc. In addition, often people ask each other "How much time/effort took for you to get until at this level?"

The hard thing is, Self-Taught persons do not necessary have those luxuries of a company holding our back, to secure to another company or a recruiter that we are capable to do something their job require. Of course we can do courses in places like Udemy, Coursera or boot camps too, because being a Self-Taught is a philosophy, not a category that you are placed just because you don't do college or pay a boot camp. 

Being a Self-Taught mean stopping being worry about what a company or recruiter thinks about you, and stop with the need for a place to get the experience and expertise that you want. We do not care too much about the common sense of being a "good employer", because our energy and good comes from the love to do something, not from the need to prove something. Therefore, the curriculum I will show you bellow can be interpreted like: "Wow, that guys pass through all this?" or "Naah, anyone can put some links from Youtube and say they know something"

My purpose here is to create a list of every single free content that I had study. Both to guide people who feel lost about find a learning path, and for people who want to see my curriculum to check what I know.
